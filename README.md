2025/11/24 添加了红黑方轮流下棋的功能；添加重新开始与悔棋的功能

未完成的部分：
1. Implement a login system supporting both guests and registered users.  
2. Guests can play directly but cannot save or load game progress.  
3. The user login interface includes a registration page and allows login after entering account credentials.
4. After the program exits and is run again, previously registered users can still log in.
5.  Each registered user can save their current game progress (board state, player turn, move history).  
6. Each user must have at least one save slot(multiple saves are optional but not required).  
7. Players can load their previous save from the start menu.  
8. Handle corrupted or modified save files gracefully (do not crash).  
9. Implementing auto-save on exit or time-stamped saves earns extra credit.
10.  Implement capturing, checking, and checkmate detection.  
11. Show appropriate messages for check, checkmate, stalemate, and draw.  
12. Provide an option to surrender (resign).
13. Display the previous move on the interface (e.g., highlight the moved piece or show textual record).
14. Detect game victory and display a victory message.
15. Implementing full draw and stalemate rule detection is complex — count it as a bonus. (不强制要求)
16. Implement a graphical board and interactive piece movement using JavaFX, Swing, or any 
other Java GUI framework.  
17. Players should be able to move pieces via mouse click-and-drop or by selecting start and 
destination tiles.  
18. Display game status (turn, check, game over) visually.  
19. If your program runs only via command line without GUI interaction, you will not get full 
marks in this section.  
20. Independently creating the GUI without using the provided demo code will count as 
advanced points.
